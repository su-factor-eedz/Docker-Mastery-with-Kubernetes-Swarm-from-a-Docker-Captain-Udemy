# 18. Check Our Docker Install and Config
- [docker version]
- [docker info]
- Used to be [docker run]
- Now is [docker container run] in [docker command + sub-command] form after the number of commands exploded and needed to become grouped
- New commands will not have short format; must be a sub-command of existing command

# 19. Starting a Nginx Web Server
- Image - binaries, libraries, source code,... that make up your application
- Container - running instance of Image as a process
- Registry - storage for container images (e.g. Docker Hub)
- [docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx]
- NOTE: For Windows, Ctrl-C exits foreground container process but leave it running in background
- [docker container run --publsih 80:80 --detach nginx]
-- returns unique container id
-- NOTE: For Windows, additional command to stop container: [docker stop <container id/name>]
- [docker container ls] OLD WAY: [docker ps]
- [docker container stop <first few digits of id>] OLD WAY: [docker stop <first few digits of id>] stops container but doesn't remove it
- [docker container ls] only shows running containers
- [docker container ls -a] shows stopped ones too
- [docker container run] ALWAYS starts new container
- [docker container start] starts an EXISTING stopped one
- *Container ID* is created for us and *Container Name* is as well if we don't specify (the latter, which will use adjectives and surnames of notable hackers or scientists)
- [docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach --name webhost nginx]
- [docker container logs webhost]
- [docker container top webhost] shows process running inside the container
- [docker container rm] OLDWAY: [docker rm] to delete one or more containers
-- [docker container rm 63f 690...]
-- but must first stop running containers OR force it: [docker container rm -f 63f]
