# 55. Docker Compose and The docker-compose.yml File
## Docker Compose
- configure relationships between containers
- save docker container run settings in easy-to-read file
- spin them up and tear down with one command

### Two Parts of Docker Compose
1. YAML File - describes solution options for containers, networks, volumes, environment variables, images, ...
2. [docker-compose] CLI Tool - used for local dev/test automation with those YAML files

- Docker Compose used to be called "fig" -- version 1, though it didn't have a version line
- Compose YAML Format has its own versions, which are now specified as the first line in the file
- as of [version 1.13+], can be used beyond local dev/test in production with [Swarm] using [docker] command lin
- [docker-compose --help]
- [docker-compose.yml] default filename
- [docker-compose.yml -f] can be used to specify different file name
- [spaces] in hierarchy have a YAML-specific convention
- At minimum, have [version] start with at least v 2 outherwise lose features and [services] correspond to the containers; [volumes] are like volume create and [networks] like network create are [optional]
- see /Proj/study/udemy/udemy-docker-mastery/compose-sample-1 [template.yml], [docker-compose.yml] where [ports] is for [--publish], [compose-2.yml] where [environment] list doesn't use dashes, and [compose-3.yml] where [environment] does use dashes and [depends_on] in [mysql-secondary] service is used to show relationship to [mysql-primary] service.

# 56. Trying Out Basic Compose Commands
## Docker Compose CLI Tool
- comes with Docker for Windows/Mac, but needs download for Linux
- not for production, meant for local development/testing
- [docker-compose up] for doing everying in the compose file
- [docker-compose down] for removing everything like container, volumes, networks
- SCENARIO: if all projects had a [Dockerfile] and [docker-compose.yml], someone can be onboarded with:
[git clone github.com/some/software]
[docker-compose up]
