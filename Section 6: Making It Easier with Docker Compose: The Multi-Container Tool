# 55. Docker Compose and The docker-compose.yml File
## Docker Compose
- configure relationships between containers
- save docker container run settings in easy-to-read file
- spin them up and tear down with one command

### Two Parts of Docker Compose
1. YAML File - describes solution options for containers, networks, volumes, environment variables, images, ...
2. [docker-compose] CLI Tool - used for local dev/test automation with those YAML files

- Docker Compose used to be called "fig" -- version 1, though it didn't have a version line
- Compose YAML Format has its own versions, which are now specified as the first line in the file
- as of [version 1.13+], can be used beyond local dev/test in production with [Swarm] using [docker] command lin
- [docker-compose --help]
- [docker-compose.yml] default filename
- [docker-compose.yml -f] can be used to specify different file name
