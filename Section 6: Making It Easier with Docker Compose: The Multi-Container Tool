# 55. Docker Compose and The docker-compose.yml File
## Docker Compose
- configure relationships between containers
- save docker container run settings in easy-to-read file
- spin them up and tear down with one command

### Two Parts of Docker Compose
1. YAML File - describes solution options for containers, networks, volumes, environment variables, images, ...
2. [docker-compose] CLI Tool - used for local dev/test automation with those YAML files

- Docker Compose used to be called "fig" -- version 1, though it didn't have a version line
- Compose YAML Format has its own versions, which are now specified as the first line in the file
- as of [version 1.13+], can be used beyond local dev/test in production with [Swarm] using [docker] command lin
- [docker-compose --help]
- [docker-compose.yml] default filename
- [docker-compose -f] can be used to specify different file name
- [spaces] in hierarchy have a YAML-specific convention
- At minimum, have [version] start with at least v 2 outherwise lose features and [services] correspond to the containers; [volumes] are like volume create and [networks] like network create are [optional]
- see /Proj/study/udemy/udemy-docker-mastery/compose-sample-1 [template.yml], [docker-compose.yml] where [ports] is for [--publish], [compose-2.yml] where [environment] list doesn't use dashes, and [compose-3.yml] where [environment] does use dashes and [depends_on] in [mysql-secondary] service is used to show relationship to [mysql-primary] service.

# 56. Trying Out Basic Compose Commands
## Docker Compose CLI Tool
- comes with Docker for Windows/Mac, but needs download for Linux
- not for production, meant for local development/testing
- [docker-compose up] for doing everying in the compose file
- [docker-compose down] for removing everything like container, volumes, networks
- SCENARIO: if all projects had a [Dockerfile] and [docker-compose.yml], someone can be onboarded with:
[git clone github.com/some/software]
[docker-compose up]
### open: /Proj/study/udemy/udemy-docker-mastery/compose-sample-2
[docker-compose up]
vs
[docker-compose -d]
- The "It works!" message comes from the Apache server through the Nginx server

# 57. Assignment: Build a Compose File For a Multi-Container Service
- create a compose file from scratch for Drupal content management system website
- needs database, so use [drupal] image and [postgres] image
- export port 8080 for drupal
- version 2
- set [POSTGRES_PASSWORD] environment variable for postgres
- Drupal assumes DB is "localhost" with web server and database in SAME container

# 58. Assignment Answers: Build a Compose File For a Multi-Container Service

##MY ANSWERS (WRONG - NOT WORKING - )##
###ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
services.myPostgres.volumes contains an invalid type, it should be an array
Unsupported config option for services.myPostgres: 'network'###

version: '2'

# same as 
# docker run -p 80:4000 -v $(pwd):/site bretfisher/jekyll-serve

# database default name is postgres not POSTGRES_USER

[docker-compose down -v] to also remove volumes


# 59. Adding Image Building to Compose Files
- adding image building to compose files
- ensures image is ready to go when using compose commands
- looks in cache for image, building with [docker-compose up] only if image is not found
- use [docker-compose build] to rebuild if you make changes or [docker-compose up --build]
- good when using compose locally and complex with custom environment variables or build arguments (environment variables only available during builds)

QUESTION: why does lesson have [image: nginx-custom] in the "proxy" service but not in the file from Git?

[docker-compose up -d]
[docker-compose down --rmi local] deletes images as well that DON'T have a custom tag
[docker-compose down --rmi all] removes ALL images created by project

buildðŸ”—
Configuration options that are applied at build time.

build can be specified either as a string containing a path to the build context:

version: "3.7"
services:
  webapp:
    build: ./dir
Or, as an object with the path specified under context and optionally Dockerfile and args:

version: "3.7"
services:
  webapp:
    build:
      context: ./dir
      dockerfile: Dockerfile-alternate
      args:
        buildno: 1
If you specify image as well as build, then Compose names the built image with the webapp and optional tag specified in image:

build: ./dir
image: webapp:tag
This results in an image named webapp and tagged tag, built from ./dir.


# 60. Assignment: Compose For Run-Time Image Building and Multi-Container Development
- same compose file as before but with a custom Drupal image from the official repository
- sys admin or software tester of drupal apps
- create a Dockerfile that is a custom image of Drupal with a template added
- Dockerfile with a bootstrap template that will allow to add the template into the GUI of Drupal
- Make [Dockerfile] and [docker-compose.yml] in dir [compose-assignment-2]
- Use [drupal] image and [postgres] image
- [compose-assignment-2] has a [README.md] with details
