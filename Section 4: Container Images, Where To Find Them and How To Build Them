36. What's In An Image (and What Isn't)
Image
- app binaries and dependencies
- metadata about the image data and how to run the image
- official: "An image is an ordered collection of root filesystem changes and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container runtime"
- not a complete OS -- no kernel, no kernel modules (e.g. drivers)
- as small as one file, or as big as an Ubuntu distro with apt, Apache, PHP and more installed


37. The Mighty Hub: Using Docker Hub Registry Images
Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/
- rare to want your software to update automatically; instead, you usually want to control that process with some other DevOps tool
- vet an image by:
-- looking at number of pulls and number of stars
-- looking at an open source repository that shows how the image was made
