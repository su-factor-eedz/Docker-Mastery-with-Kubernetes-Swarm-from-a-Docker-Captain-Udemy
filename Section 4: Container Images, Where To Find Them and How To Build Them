36. What's In An Image (and What Isn't)
Image
- app binaries and dependencies
- metadata about the image data and how to run the image
- official: "An image is an ordered collection of root filesystem changes and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container runtime"
- not a complete OS -- no kernel, no kernel modules (e.g. drivers)
- as small as one file, or as big as an Ubuntu distro with apt, Apache, PHP and more installed


37. The Mighty Hub: Using Docker Hub Registry Images
Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/
- rare to want your software to update automatically; instead, you usually want to control that process with some other DevOps tool
- vet an image by:
-- looking at number of pulls and number of stars
-- looking at an open source repository that shows how the image was made

38. Images and Their Layers: Discover the Image Cache
[docker image ls]
[docker history nginx:latest]
- every image starts with a blank layer known as [scratch]
- every set of changes on the file system in the image is another [layer]
- every layer gets its own unique [sha] to allow system to confirm that layer is different from another layer, storing each layer only once on a host
[Copy-on-Write] when container changes a layer on the image; copies file out into container's differencing for storage in container layer
[docker image inspect nginx] gives you [metadata] for an image

*About storage drivers*
https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/
- "Containers that write a lot of data consume more space than containers that do not. This is because most write operations consume new space in the container’s thin writable top layer.

Note: for write-heavy applications, you should not store the data in the container. Instead, use Docker volumes, which are independent of the running container and are designed to be efficient for I/O. In addition, volumes can be shared among containers and do not increase the size of your container’s writable layer."
